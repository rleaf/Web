      Hello my name is Ryan Lin. This site is intended to provide a synopsis of what I enjoy doing and who I am.
      Amongst what is already mentioned below, I also enjoy
      <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe8X-Ib4hEc7keoBQ7cMdmA' target='_blank'>power / olympic lifting</a>,
      <a href='https://www.instagram.com/ryli.d/' target='_blank'>eating / cooking</a>, and playing games.
      Contrast to Behance, some works published here are more oriented towards providing step-by-step insight.
