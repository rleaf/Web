      Hello my name is Ryan Lin. This site is intended to provide a synopsis of what I enjoy doing and who I am.
      Amongst what is already mentioned below, I also enjoy
      <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe8X-Ib4hEc7keoBQ7cMdmA' target='_blank'>power / olympic lifting</a>,
      <a href='https://www.instagram.com/rylikefood/' target='_blank'>eating / cooking</a>, and playing games. 
      Extraneous to design, I spend a lot of my extra time learning more about code and machine learning applications. Some works published here are more oriented towards providing step-by-step insight to 
      show my design process.
