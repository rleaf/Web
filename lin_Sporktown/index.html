			<h2>The Sporktown Scoop</h2>
				<p>
					Many people can’t believe there is a town named after a tool that is
					combination spoon and fork. The truth is the town is named after its
					founder James T. Spork. He founded the town using the wealth from his
					invention of the plastic Spork. Few people know it was actually his own
					last name that inspired the idea of the famous spoon fork combination!

					<h3>From Humble Beginnings</h3>
					<p>
						If James T. Spork were still alive today he’d be amazed to see how the town has grown.
						What started as a few homes and a small factory, is now a bustling city and cultural
						center. While Sporktown has changed, at its heart we have kept true to Mr. Spork’s vision.
						We must never forget our origin and keep the innovation, warmth and honesty that filled his heart.
